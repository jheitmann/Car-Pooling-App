Attack Plan:

- figure out how to connect to the database and display a whole table
- Figure out how to update a table (add new row)


- Create the following pages:

index.php


ride.php
	Create a ride.php so it displays whole ride table.
	Make a login in page so you can create your own USER:

	Display all rides.
	Button: SIGN UP FOR RIDE

	-Sign up to a ride with your email:
		if email is not in the USER table:
			Error - ”You need to create an account.
			
	Update COMPLETED RIDES with the RIDE (rideID (car&date)) and the USER
	-If the rideID already exists in COMPLETED RIDES:
		-Add USER/CLIENT to that rideID(car&date) in COMPLETED RIDES
	-Else:
		-Create a new row in COMPLETED RIDES with USER and RIDE (rideID(car&date))


createAccount.php

	Just a form to create new user and update the database

	-If the userID(email) is new:
		-update USER-table with new USER row
	-Else (if the email is already in the user table):
		- Error ”You already have an account, sign up to a ride with your email”
